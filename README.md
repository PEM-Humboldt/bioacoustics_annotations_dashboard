# Bioacustics Annotations Dashboard (BADASH üê∏)

BADASH is a streamlit app for visulization of bounding box annotations. (Explain what is annotations in Bioacustics and add protocol) Exploratory Data Analysis
Fast and way to check the consistency of used codes for annotation

## How to play with BADASH üê∏?

1. Open this [link](https://github.com/) to use BADASH üê∏. 

2. Upload a set of annotations. You can use [these](https://github.com/juansulloa/soundclim_annotations/tree/master/bounding_boxes/INCT41) annotations to play with BADASH üê∏. 

## How to use BADASH üê∏ in my project?

### 1. Installing and Running


1. Clone this repo in your computer:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/jscanass/bioacoustics_annotations_dashboard.git
```

2. Use a [virtual environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) to avoid tampering other Python installations in your system. BADASH üê∏ works with Python versions 3.7. Install requirements and environment:

```shell
cd bioacoustics_annotations_dashboard
conda create --name badash_env
conda activate badash_env
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run streamlit app:
```shell
streamlit run app.py
```

Feel free to modify the code of BADASH üê∏

### 2. Annotations

Follow the same format for annotations in your project as [examples](https://github.com/juansulloa/soundclim_annotations/tree/master/bounding_boxes/INCT41). The name of each file follow this structure: {SITE}_{DATE}.txt

### 3. Dictionary

Modify the species and quality dictionary following the same structure of the Species_code_Annotations.xlsx file.
